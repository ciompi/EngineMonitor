This is a monitoring tool for marine diesel engines.  It should not be considered "Marine Grade" and should not be relied upon to make decisions that affect safety.  It is built with the following principles:

*  Working with electronics is fun

*  Older marine diesels lack decent monitoring systems

*  Marine engine monitoring systems are very expensive and this device can be built for around $100
